 Intelligent Waste Classification and Contamination Detection:
This project presents a web-based system that uses deep learning to automatically classify waste into categories like paper, plastic, metal, and glass, while also detecting visual contamination (e.g., stains or food residues). It is designed for real-time, scalable deployment in smart recycling environments.

 Key Features:
    Dual-Task System: Waste classification and contamination detection in one model.

    Lightweight Deep Learning: Uses MobileNetV3 for fast, efficient performance.

     Web Interface: Accessible platform for real-time interaction.

      Dataset: Trained on the TACO dataset (over 2000 labeled images).

 Tech Stack:
   Python, TensorFlow/Keras

    MobileNetV3 (Small & Large variants)

    HTML/CSS/JS for the web platform

      Hosted for demonstration via Flask/Streamlit

 Results:
   High classification accuracy and efficient contamination detection. 92% for classification and 89% for contamination datection

    Achieves strong performance while remaining lightweight and web-deployable. 

Future Work:
   Integration with IoT-enabled smart bins.

    Mobile app support.

    Multilingual interface for wider accessibility.
